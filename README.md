# DS-GA1008 Deep Learning

This is my homework for the DS-GA1008 Deep Learning by Yann LeCun, Alfredo Canziani, and Joan Bruna at NYU Courant & CDS in Fall 2021. I do not guarantee the correctness of my solution as there are errors in them. You should check out the accompanying tutorials on [this site](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/). The video lectures (in 2020 Spring) are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLHTzKZzVU9eaEyErdV26ikyolxOsz6mq).
