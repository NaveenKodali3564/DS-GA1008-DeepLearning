# DS-GA1008 Deep Learning

This is my homework for the DS-GA1008 Deep Learning by Yann LeCun, Alfredo Canziani, and Joan Bruna at NYU Courant & CDS in Fall 2021. I do not guarantee the correctness of my solution as there are errors in them. You should check out the accompanying tutorials on [this site](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/). The video lectures (in 2020 Spring) are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLHTzKZzVU9eaEyErdV26ikyolxOsz6mq). All the homework consists of a theory part and a coding part.

## HW1

The HW1 coding asks us to implement forward pass and backpropagation manually.

## HW2

HW2 centers around the Curse of Dimensionality. Question 2, 12, 14 are coding questions that accompanies the theoretical questions.

## HW3

HW3 focuses on a CNN of cats-dogs classifier and a RNN that echoes the input with a certain delay

## Midterm HW

Graph Neural Network on community detection

## HW4

Energy-based Model on text recognition on images

## Final HW

Generative Model & Variational Inference
